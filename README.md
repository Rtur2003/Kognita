*The Art of Understanding Your Digital Footprint.*

Kognita is a silent, local-first desktop activity tracker that helps you understand how you spend your time on your computer. It's not a surveillance tool, but a personal analytics engine designed for self-awareness and productivity. **All of your data is stored locally on your machine and is never shared with anyone.**

*(Hint: You can create a GIF like this by recording your screen, placing the file in an `assets` folder, and updating the link.)*

## ‚ú® Features

  * ü§´ **Silent Background Tracking:** Runs quietly in the background without requiring a persistent terminal window.
  * üñ±Ô∏è **Smart Idle Detection:** Intelligently detects when you're away from your keyboard and mouse, pausing the timer to ensure only active usage is logged.
  * **System Tray Integration:** Lives in the Windows System Tray for minimal intrusion.
  * üìä **Simple GUI Reporting:** A clean, user-friendly window displays your activity report with a single click.
  * üß† **Digital Persona Analysis:** Analyzes your usage patterns to assign you a fun "digital persona" like "Productivity Guru" or "Focused Gamer".
  * üîí **Privacy-First:** All data is stored in a local SQLite database file (`kognita_data.db`) within the project folder. Nothing ever leaves your computer.
